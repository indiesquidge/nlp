# [Next Level Playing][1] Helper

When I started to take music more seriously, one of the initial goals was to
get to know the guitar better. What are the notes of particular frets? How
quickly can I find a C note on the D string? What is the shape of the major
and minor barre chords? What are the triad notes of a particular chord?

Learning these things was hard. One thing that helped a lot was having a tool to
challenge me. I started by writing out simple functions that I ran through the
CLI, but figured it could be interesting to build a UI around those functions
and publish it to help others.
